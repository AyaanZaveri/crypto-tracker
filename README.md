# Crypto Tracker
**Crypto Tracker:** https://crypto-tracker-ayaanzaveri08.vercel.app/

Crypto Tracker (I'll change the name, don't worry) tracks crypto with the [**CoinGecko API**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api). This app uses the [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) framework created by [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/), and [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the UI.

## Run the app locally.
Run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev` to run the app locally. Although, you could view right over [here](https://crypto-tracker-ayaanzaveri08.vercel.app/).
