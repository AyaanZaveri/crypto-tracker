# Crypto Tracker
Crypto Tracker (I'll change the name, don't worry) tracks crypto with the [**CoinGecko API**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api). This app uses the [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) framework created by **Meta**, and [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the UI.

## Currently working on:
- A Trending Cryptocurrencies Section
- [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes)

## Run the app locally.
Run `npm run dev` to run the app locally. Although, you could view right over [here](https://crypto-tracker-ayaanzaveri08.vercel.app/).
